# Recent App Review Frontend #

This is a nextjs react frontend. It is pretty simple and straight forward -- not many bells and whistles here.
I have not played with react in some time and this project illustrated to me how much the landscape has changed
since I worked with it.

I am certain things could be done better. I hope you see wisdom in "Knowing what I don't know". This is an area
that I need to improve my knowledge. Hopefully what I have pulled off here shows that I can learn on the fly.

I'm sure that the project could use some better structure around the components. The component tree might be
a little more complicated than necessary.

Visual design is not my fort√©, but given a theme, I can stick to it.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the project.
